## Description 
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare datasets to investigate and predict the likelihood of certain heart diseases based on patient characteristics, lifestyle, and medical history. This can be helpful for patients and the general public to gain an informed assessment and general understanding of a disease state and its causes.  We will be merging healthcare data on cardiovascular/heart disease from multiple datasets and sources.
